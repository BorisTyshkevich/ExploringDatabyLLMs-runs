Generate only the artifacts requested in this prompt.
Stay within the configured dataset scope.

Dataset semantic layer:

Use `ontime.ontime` as the primary fact table for flight operations.

Use `ontime.airports_latest` as the semantic airport dimension for current airport reference data, including:

- `code`
- `name`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `utc_local_time_variation`

`ontime.airports_latest` can be used directly to get coordinates and other columns for enrichment in application code (such as JavaScript or python)
or used for SQL JOINs.

Preferred sql joins:

- `ontime.ontime.OriginAirportID = ontime.airports_latest.airport_id`
- `ontime.ontime.DestAirportID = ontime.airports_latest.airport_id`

For `ontime.ontime`, use `OriginAirportID` and `DestAirportID` when enriching airport names, coordinates, or other airport attributes inside SQL.
Do not join `ontime.ontime` legs directly to `ontime.airports_latest` by airport code when the airport id columns are already available.

Fallback sql joins:

- use `ontime.ontime.Origin = ontime.airports_latest.code`
- use `ontime.ontime.Dest = ontime.airports_latest.code`

Generate only the visual artifact.

The analytical run already produced:

- `query.sql`
- `visual_input.json`

Use `query.sql` as the authoritative input for the primary data query.
Use `visual_input.json` to understand the result shape before building visuals.
You may construct additional queries when needed for enrichment or drill-down, but do not regenerate the saved SQL.

Return exactly this fenced section:

```html

Create `visual.html` using the `ontime-analyst-dashboard` skill as a downloadable artifact only (no need to display as code block).

The returned `visual.html` must be final browser-ready HTML. qforge will not patch or rewrite it after generation.

General visual rules:

- Derive KPIs, chart values, table rows, filters, and highlights from the actual analytical data. Do not invent or hardcode them.
- Respect the declared visual mode and visual type shown below.
- Follow question-specific visual guidance after the shared contract. Put reusable runtime behavior in shared page code, not in prose comments.
- Keep report logic out of `visual.html`; qforge already renders `report.md` separately.

Saved SQL to preserve in the final page contract:

Visual context:

- Question title: `Highest daily hops for one aircraft on one flight number`
- Visual mode: `dynamic`
- Visual type: `html_map`

Question-specific visual guidance:

The page must:

- show a lead-itinerary map that remains present even before airport-coordinate enrichment succeeds
- treat the first row returned by the primary query as the default selected itinerary on initial load
- derive hop count, stop sequence, and repeated-route comparisons from the result set
- label the map as airport-coordinate enrichment in the query ledger
- reuse the enrichment results for any itinerary selected from the primary result set without issuing a new per-click enrichment query
- include KPI cards for tail number, flight number, date, hop count, and route repetition context, with the date shown as its own visible KPI value
- keep the KPI strip anchored to the top-ranked result even when the selected itinerary changes
- include a legend plus both a route sequence/detail panel and an itinerary table below the map
- make itinerary table rows clickable so selecting a row redraws the map and refreshes the route sequence/detail panel for that itinerary
- show a clear active-row state for the selected itinerary that is distinct from simple hover styling
- if enrichment fails or the selected itinerary lacks enough coordinates, keep the map card visible with degraded-state messaging for that selected itinerary, report the degraded map in the ledger, and continue rendering the non-map analysis

Dynamic-mode additions:

- Use this endpoint template for every browser query: `https://mcp.demo.altinity.cloud/{JWE}/openapi/execute_query?query=...`
- Keep JWE in `localStorage['OnTimeAnalystDashboard::auth::jwe']`.
- Do not embed the primary analytical dataset as `result.json` payloads or CSV snapshots.
