- **Max hops: 8** (9 airports in one day), achieved by Southwest Airlines (WN) across multiple flight numbers
- **Most recent top itinerary**: WN 366, tail N957WN, 2024-12-01 — `ISP → BWI → MYR → BNA → VPS → DAL → LAS → OAK → SEA`, first departure 05:43 from ISP
- **Pattern**: WN 3149 (`CLE→BNA→PNS→HOU→MCI→PHX→BUR→OAK→DEN`) operates the same 8-hop rotation on 4 separate dates with different tail numbers — a fixed scheduled rotation, not a one-off
